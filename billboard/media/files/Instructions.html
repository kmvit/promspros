<h2>Note</h2>
<p>We are use this extension as it is on our life online store and are satisfied. It really saves us a lot of time. Hopefully it will be useful. If so please say thank you. If not. Don't say anything :) I'm not professional web developer so this extension isn't perfect and has some bugs. It works well when adding images to the product with no additional images. When there are some it will overwrite them and creates another empty slot(s). It could be challenge for somebody else..... Since i have no time to make it better.</p>
